## Background
The background of the problem that this website aims to resolve is the creation of an online CV for myself. I've chosen to do an online CV as my website as I have realised the difficulty of proving technical knowledge to interviewers when applying for IT-based roles without some visible proof of knowledge or work experience references, which has put me at a disadvantage on several occasions. This website aims to not only show off my capabilities as an employee to a potential company but to also demonstrate enough technical knowledge in terms of coding in HTML5, CSS and JavaScript to convince potential employers that I would be able to learn other types of software/ programming languages depending on the needs of the business, regardless of previous experience or knowledge.

## Colour choices
Regarding the choice of colours, I have chosen to take my inspiration from apps that are currently utilising "dark mode" colour schemes which utilise darker backgrounds, brighter borders for sections and white as the font colour. For my background colour, I had chosen to utilise the RGB colour picker plug in to obtain my ideal shade of grey (RGB 45,45,49) and make the borders and text white. For the menu, I had decided to implement dark red as the background colour to ensure the website would be more visually distinctive than a generic black and white colour scheme as previous experience with website design has taught me that a maximum of 3 base colours is sufficient enough to make an appealing website without overcomplicating the websites aesthetic. The reason why I had chosen to implement a dark mode theme is because of the claims that using dark mode websites allows for significantly less eye strain as much as their brighter counterparts, which would make the site easier to read if an employer spends a significant amount of time using a device which has a high brightness setting. Utilizing a dark mode theme by default also allows for colour blind users to have better ease of navigation through the text on my website.

## Accessibility
In terms of accessibility regarding my website, I have made sure that all my pictures have included alt text underneath them, as per W3C accessibility guidelines. I have also taken the initiative for farsighted users by increasing the default font size to 18 as to ensure any contact forms can be filled in with ease. Users who have visual impairments that significantly hinder their use of the website without assistance will not be affected regardless of the implementation of measures on my parts due to a majority of Windows 10 users, as well as smartphone and tablet users will have access to accessibility features in the device software such as readers and virtual assistants that can dictate the content on any page of my website.

## Data protection and GDPR
In compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation, I have identified that the only section of my website that will require for me to comply with this regulation is my contacts page as the form I have implemented will gather personal data about users. For a future iteration to my online CV, a privacy policy may need to be implemented to clarify how data will be gathered, stored, utilised and managed but is not necessary at this point as there is no working database connected to the form. However, I intend to build on and eventually upload it on the web hosting service InfinityFree.net and will, therefore, need to design a working database to store data captured in the form. When the website is capable of being implemented as a real solution to my self-promotion problem, it will be necessary to identify that infinity free will be able to access and manage my account data as they have administrator access to all files stored on their database. In the privacy policy, it will also be necessary to outline that I will need to bear responsibility in ensuring that users will have the right to access, correct, obtain gathered data for their own purposes, deny alteration requests and delete the data stored on the back-end database, as well as the right to be informed about their data in order to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation. Regarding the simplicity of the website as its current stage, the 8th rights concerning automated decision-making and profiling are not applicable to my website due to a lack of automated systems in place.

## Distance Selling
Since the website is made for personal use and not for selling goods or services online, my website does not have to conform to the online and distance selling act as its primary use is to help me show a sufficient level of technical knowledge in job interviews, with its secondary use being a point of contact. However, since I intend to host the website using a third-party web hosting service it should be made clear that cost will only be taken into account if InfinityFree.net's service is no longer viable for further iterations which may include more web pages, which is highly unlikely.

## Evaluation
In regards to the current state of the website, I feel like I had achieved the base goal of what I wanted to do in terms of designing a unique, responsive online CV that I could build on in the future. Each of the 4 pages that were made all conform to a uniform standard regarding the colour schema, the navigation bar layouts and the contact page form working exactly how I wanted it to. Furthermore, I am proud of how I was able to make the CSS script work as planned across all 4 pages. 
While I can say I'm impressed with the quality of the website as it is, there were various setbacks dating back 2 months ago that severely hindered progress along with certain aspects I wanted to include but had not been able to complete. Originally, I had intended to include a search bar which could link across all four pages to find content quickly for employers of which was not able to happen due to time constraints. I also wanted to further develop my JavaScript exception handling so that each data input has exception handling to ensure no blank data was entered, alongside hiding the submit button until the consent text box had been filled out correctly. While there were several problems regarding my a lot of time for him, the one technical issue which severely hindered progress was my attempt of using the Gitpod IDE to write and commit the scripts to the repository in a simpler manner which resulted in chunks of my codes not appearing in the repository. Regarding my design choices the main reason why I chose my colour scheme was because I wanted to make the website aesthetically pleasing, professional, simplistic and able to accommodate people who are colour blind/ and a significant amount of time I'm each day looking at bright screens. I only settled on the idea after realising that my phone has implemented a dark mode to help reduce eye strain, which is unavoidable for most office workers who cannot implement third party software on their office workstations without the help of an administrator. As the site uses a Sans, Times New Roman font in white, it ensures that colour blind users will have no difficulty in in in reading the text on each page.
