            <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>My name is Hayden Coleman. Iâ€™m a 20-year-old Business IT student at Southampton Solent University and I have created this website as an attempt to create a unique online CV. <br> 
                        The aim of this is to display My CV in a different manner then activate traditional Word document or a Basic online CV used by companies such as Reed and Indeed. <br>
                        I had chosen to create an online CV from scratch because I believe it is the easiest way to showcase my technical knowledge in advance of an interview, And I hope that she you see that this is the case .</p>
